''' Pure Gems Store sells different varieties of gems to its customers.
Emerald, Ivory, Jasper, Ruby, Garnet and their prices are 1760, 2119, 1599, 3920, 3999 respectively.
Write a Python program to calculate the bill amount to be paid by a customer based on the list of gems and quantity purchased. 
Any purchase with a total bill amount above Rs.30000 is entitled for 5% discount. 
If any gem required by the customer is not available in the store, then consider total bill amount to be -1.
Assume that quantity required by the customer for any gem will always be greater than 0.
Perform case-sensitive comparison wherever applicable. '''
